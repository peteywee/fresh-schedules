# Security Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the security improvements implemented to address the concerns identified in PR review issue #44.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Insecure Onboarding Token ✅
**Original Concern**: `redeemJoinToken` directly uses a user-supplied token as `orgId`, allowing arbitrary membership creation to any known org path.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created `functions/src/invites.ts` with secure `redeemJoinToken` Cloud Function
- Invite tokens are stored in Firestore with:
  - `organizationId`: The actual org ID (not user-supplied)
  - `role`: The role to be granted
  - `expiresAt`: Token expiration timestamp
  - `used`: Single-use flag
- Server-side validation includes:
  - Authentication check
  - Token existence verification
  - Expiry validation
  - Already-used check
  - Duplicate membership prevention
- Atomic transaction ensures single-use token consumption
- Firestore rules prevent client-side token creation

**Files Modified**:
- `functions/src/invites.ts` (new)
- `functions/src/index.ts`
- `firebase/firestore.rules` (invites collection)
- `packages/types/src/index.ts` (InviteToken schema)

---

### 2. Firestore Rule Self-Assign Update ✅
**Original Concern**: The shift update rule allows updates if `assignedUid` is set but doesn't restrict other fields, enabling privilege escalation.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added helper functions to Firestore rules:
  ```firestore
  function isMemberOfOrg(orgId)
  function getMemberRole(orgId)
  function isOrgManager(orgId)
  function onlyFieldsChanged(allowedFields)
  ```
- Split shift update rules into two conditions:
  1. **Managers**: Can update any field
  2. **Staff**: Can only self-assign if:
     - Shift is currently unassigned (`assignedUid == null`)
     - Assigning to themselves (`assignedUid == request.auth.uid`)
     - Only `assignedUid` and `updatedAt` fields change
- Prevents privilege escalation by restricting field modifications during self-assignment

**Files Modified**:
- `firebase/firestore.rules` (shift rules, helper functions)

---

### 3. Attendance Ledger Secrecy ✅
**Original Concern**: Ledger writes are locked down but need proper `LEDGER_HASH_SALT` handling and structured logging without sensitive data leakage.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created attendance ledger collection with strict Firestore rules:
  ```firestore
  match /attendance_ledger/{entryId} {
    allow read, write: if false;
  }
  ```
- Implemented secure ledger entry creation in `autoClockOutWorker`:
  - Validates `LEDGER_HASH_SALT` environment variable early
  - Returns early if salt not configured
  - Generates HMAC-SHA256 hash for each entry
  - Hash includes: shiftId, staffUid, clockInAt, clockOutAt
- Structured logging without sensitive data:
  - Logs operation summaries
  - Excludes timestamps and user IDs from production logs
  - Error messages don't leak sensitive details

**Files Modified**:
- `functions/src/attendance.ts` (new)
- `firebase/firestore.rules` (attendance_ledger collection)
- `packages/types/src/index.ts` (AttendanceLedger schema)

---

### 4. Functions Robustness (Timezone) ✅
**Original Concern**: `autoClockOutWorker` uses `serverTimestamp` for `updatedAt` but not `outAt`. If `shiftEnd` is constructed on a machine with different timezone, it can leak local time variance.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Configured function with explicit UTC timezone:
  ```typescript
  onSchedule({
    schedule: "0 * * * *",
    timeZone: "UTC",
    maxInstances: 1,
  })
  ```
- Uses Firestore `Timestamp` type throughout:
  - `Timestamp.now()` for current time
  - Queries use `where("endTime", "<", now)` with Firestore Timestamp
  - Sets `clockOutAt` to shift's `endTime` (already a Firestore Timestamp)
  - Uses `Timestamp.now()` for `autoClockOutAt` audit field
- No local timestamp construction or timezone conversion
- All timestamps stored as UTC in Firestore
- Consistent timestamp handling prevents timezone variance issues

**Files Modified**:
- `functions/src/attendance.ts`

---

## Additional Improvements

### Organization Members Collection
**Purpose**: Track organization membership with roles

**Implementation**:
- Nested collection under organizations: `/organizations/{orgId}/members/{userId}`
- Fields: `userId`, `organizationId`, `role`, `joinedAt`, `invitedBy`
- Firestore rules:
  - Read: User can read own membership or managers can read all
  - Write: Disabled (must use Cloud Functions)

**Files Modified**:
- `firebase/firestore.rules` (members subcollection)
- `packages/types/src/index.ts` (OrgMember schema)

## Deployment Requirements

Before deploying to production:

1. **Set Environment Variable**
   ```bash
   firebase functions:config:set ledger.hash_salt="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
   ```

2. **Deploy Firestore Rules**
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```

3. **Deploy Functions**
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only functions
   ```

4. **Verify Deployment**
   - Check Firebase Console for function deployment
   - Verify environment config is set
   - Test invite redemption in staging
   - Test shift self-assignment in staging
   - Monitor auto clock-out worker logs

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests (To Be Implemented)
- Invite token redemption (valid, expired, used, invalid)
- Shift self-assignment (allowed, denied, field restrictions)
- Auto clock-out logic (various shift states)
- Attendance ledger hash generation

### Integration Tests (To Be Implemented)
- End-to-end invite flow
- Multi-user shift assignment scenarios
- Auto clock-out worker execution
- Firestore rules enforcement

### Security Tests (To Be Implemented)

## Future Enhancements

### Recommended Additions
1. **Audit Logging**: Create dedicated audit_logs collection for security events
2. **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limits to invite redemption to prevent abuse
3. **Token Revocation**: Implement admin function to revoke invite tokens
4. **Attendance Reports**: Create manager function to query attendance ledger
5. **Member Removal**: Implement function to remove members from organizations
6. **Role Updates**: Implement function to change member roles

### Monitoring Improvements
1. Set up Cloud Monitoring alerts for:
   - High rate of failed invite redemptions
   - Unusual auto clock-out patterns
   - Environment variable missing errors
2. Create dashboard for:
   - Active invite tokens
   - Organization membership growth
   - Attendance tracking metrics

## Security Maintenance

### Regular Reviews
- [ ] Monthly audit of attendance ledger hashes
- [ ] Weekly review of failed invite redemptions
- [ ] Quarterly review of Firestore rules
- [ ] Annual security assessment of Cloud Functions

### Incident Response Plan
If security incident detected:
1. Review Cloud Functions logs for the time period
2. Check attendance ledger for hash mismatches
3. Audit organization member additions in affected orgs
4. Rotate `LEDGER_HASH_SALT` if compromised
5. Revoke and regenerate all active invite tokens
6. Notify affected users
7. Document incident and remediation steps
