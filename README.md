# Fresh Schedules

Production repo (Top Shelf Service LLC). Branch policy:
- **main**: production code only (no docs/notes/todos).
- **develop**: integration/staging.
- **notes**: personal docs, bibles, walkthroughs, research, todos.

Docs/notes/todos have specific file endings and live off `main`. See /scripts/guard-main.sh.
